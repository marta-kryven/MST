S47804928	26/October/2020	108.30.47.7	FALSE		44	M	3 hours	10 hours	2 dollars	 Most of the time I usually went towards where there were more black squares rather than a single one. Sometimes I just used my intuition on which way to go. I did not run into any problems in this survey. Happy To Participate.
S17865914	07/November/2020	104.193.58.75	TRUE	1	33	F	6 hours	10 hours	$1	 I felt that the bigger the space, the more likely it was to be there, and most of the time I was lucky with this approach. I only started with the smaller room if it was really close, and also took the relative proportion of their sizes into account, but intuitively - I did not count anything exactly. I wonder how do people do on average in this task, I would like to see how I compare to other people.

S2812871	09/February/2021	73.193.30.110	TRUE	1	27	F	6 hours	10 hours	$1	 I would try to go towards an area that had a bigger amount of blocks to be revealed, because there would be a better chance of the exit being there. But if I was closer to an area with a smaller amount of blocks then I might go there first, on the way towards going to the bigger area. I guess it depended on amount of steps I would take vs amount of blocks I would reveal. If I could walk 2 steps and reveal 3 blocks or walk 8 steps and reveal 5 then I might do the 2 steps first.
S94003603	07/February/2021	173.21.196.105	TRUE	1	53	F	6 hours	10 hours	$11	 Straight to the largest section, unless there was a small section really close to check out first.

S42579176	08/February/2021	67.242.56.2	TRUE	1	50	M	4 hours	10 minutes	$2.00	 It was pretty much random. It didn't seem like there was any kind of pattern developing, would need more mazes to confirm it. Thank you.

S9664755	30/September/2020	128.12.246.112	TRUE	1	22	F	6 hours	10 hours	$1	 Usually explored black squares from closest to farthest, especially if there was a single black square to the side. In those case I would check that out first because I knew it would be worse if I walked away but then later had to come all the way back (basically thinking #noregrets).
S78726610	29/September/2020	18.29.22.69	TRUE	1	28	F	6 hours	10 hours	$1	 Looked at the ratio of black squares to number to steps to reach there. Everything looks great!

In some cases, investigating a small patch where the odd exit may be took only a few steps, so I would do a &quot;let me just check over here real quick&quot;. very fun game! when you presented the same corridor and I made the same mistakes I'd been making - really captured my day to day frustration on getting lost in the same place time and time again

Sometimes it seemed obvious because it was rare for the exit to be in a small far away section because it usually was in a larger cluster. A few times it tricked me though.

S6630129	09/February/2021	146.115.73.211	TRUE	1	27	M	6 hours	10 hours	$1	 I tried to make probabilistic decisions based on the idea that the location would be completely random. So in a situation where it would take 5 steps to reveal 10 hidden squares, and the only other hidden square was 12 steps away, I would take my chance ignoring the single far away square. On the other hand, if there were slightly more squares, say like 10, but 10 steps away, while 4 were 2 steps away, I wagered I'd better just reveal the 4 near hidden ones rather than have to backtrack if the exit did not happen to be in the 10 square cluster.

S55878958	08/February/2021	72.221.62.244	TRUE	1	35	F	6	10	1	 Sometimes I would go to the one that was closest to me, just to see if maybe it was near. Then I would just try to think about how there's a chance that the red square is not in as many clustered black squares, but I basically went with my gut feeling and usually was right a good bit of time especially once I started getting the hang of it, as I was able to get to the square without very many steps at all. So, If I saw two four black squares near each other, I would go to the bottom first, because those squares will light up when I get there and if the red square is at the bottom, I didn't take too many steps to get to it, and if it was somewhere in the other two 4 black squares that were near each other, I wouldn't have far to go to get to them. if that makes sense. Sorry, I have a difficult time explaining things.

S89474632	09/February/2021	71.61.18.143	TRUE	1	39	M	7	10	1	 At first I started heading towards the largest groups of black squares, as they seemed to have the highest probability of revealing the exit. I wondered if the exit was placed randomly, or human-designed. I started to get the impression that they were all human placed. At first the exits seemed to be in large groups of black squares, but then there were a few maps where the exits were placed in less likely locations. They weren't super common, but there were enough thrown in there to make me question my original strategy. Because of this, I then started to play 'safer', where I would check out some of smaller clusters of black squares that were nearby earlier on. But in general, heading towards the largest cluster of black squares, and uncovering any smaller clusters along the way. Very fun and interesting maze game study. Thank you!

S40001880	26/October/2020	104.231.89.23	FALSE		49	M	4	100	1	 I tried to limit the amount of times I would double back over squares I had used already, even if was to investigate just one black square.

S96558290	08/February/2021	24.101.43.42	TRUE	1	38	F	4	100	2	 I tried to rely on my intuition.
S21173502	09/February/2021	66.115.177.139	TRUE	1	26	F	7 hours	10 hours	$2	 I went through the spaces that had the most black pictures gathered (in parallel) because it was more likely that they had the exit of the labyrinth. And well, if I was wrong, I was just going the shortest way to find my way out. I really love your experiments!!

S12588186	08/February/2021	207.98.244.180	TRUE	1	30	M	7	100	11.50	 I didn't like being risky and not uncovering things that were near by just to save steps. I liked being thorough and less risky.
S99570039	08/February/2021	107.192.158.79	TRUE	1	36	M	7 hours	10 hours	$1	 For the most part I would go to the biggest area but if it was further away in steps I would check others first so I would not have to backtrack such a large distance.
S75163036	08/February/2021	69.151.220.81	TRUE	1	23	F	6 hours	10 hours	1$	 I tried to always go to the black squares that were the closest so that if they were wrong I would have to do the least amount of back tracking. This was a more enjoyable hit compared to most on Mturk, thank you!
S12508800	16/November/2020	71.114.74.204	TRUE	1	32	F	6	10	1	 I thought about where the biggest bodies of black squares are and tried those first
S72002294	07/February/2021	67.247.68.1	TRUE	1	27	M	6 hours	10 hours	$1	 I tried to minimize the expected number of steps needed to find the red square.
S40690866	07/November/2020	64.121.102.112	TRUE	1	29	M	7	100	1	 nearest first
S11207975	07/February/2021	97.95.115.55	TRUE	1	40	M	7 hours	10	1	 I tried to go with my gut feeling where I thought the red square would be.
S25371665	07/February/2021	73.61.11.34	TRUE	1	28	M	6 hours	10	2	 i took the fewest steps possible. way underpaid
S33556439	18/November/2020	67.164.74.58	TRUE	1	55	F	4	10	$1	 Most of the time the red box was in the area that was furthest away from where I was, so most of the time, I tried the furthest area first.
S38995809	09/February/2021	32.208.144.218	TRUE	1	39	M	7 hours	10 hours	$1	 I tried to minimize clicking. This would have been much better if we could use the arrow keys instead of so much clicking
